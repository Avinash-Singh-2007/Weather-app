# Weather-app
The Real-Time Weather App is a frontend web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to check live weather conditions for any city in the world. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, sunset, and a 5-day forecast.
